		<blockquote>
			<p>Gender equality is achieved when women and men enjoy the same rights and opportunities across all sectors of society, including economic participation and decision-making, and when the different behaviours, aspirations and needs of women and men are equally valued and favoured.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Lately, there is a lot of discussion going on about gender equality. <a href = "https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2017">Research</a> shows that women are paid less for the same job, get fewer opportunities in their jobs and experience more sexual harassment. In the last century, gender equality has improved a lot. But what about the short term? Have we improved over de past 15 years? 
			Here you can see the gender equality index from European countries in 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2015. The index is based on participation and segregation in jobs, financial resources and economic situation, education, sorts of activities, power and health. A higher score means more equality between genders. <br>
			This index can be influenced by a lot of factors, but I was particularly interested in the question if economic wealth has a correlation with gender equality. GDP per capita is the most objective way to display this economic wealth. The colors in the map represent the GDP per capita.<br>
			You cannot conclude something based on two visualisations. However, it seems like most countries have improved in gender equality over the years. Economic wealth does seem to influence gender equality, however, not to great extent. <br>
			<a href = "Designchoices_RoosGreven.pdf">Here</a> you can see why I chose this data and visualised it this way.
